# Note Taker


  ## Description
  -My motivation for the project was to create a application where you can create, save and delete notes that you enter into the application.
  -The reasoning behind the project was to make it easier to keep track of important information for school or life in general.
  -The problem that is solved is having an easy way to keep track of important information without having to look through a whole lot of applications.
  -I learned how to create new functions using express.js and linking information to a server.
